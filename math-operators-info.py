#variable types

# To check var type:
type( ) #variable goes inside
    
# To change into a float
float( ) #var goes inside pars

# To change into a string
str( ) #var goes inside pars

# To set an integer aka whole number
int( ) #var goes inside pars
#4.0 is a float, 4 is an int

# ------------------------------------------------------------- MATH OPERATORS

#Addition: 
x = 3 + 7

#Subtraction
y = 7 - 3

#Multiplication
z = 3 * 7

#Division
a = 7/3

#Modulus     - Returns remainder from divison
b = 10 % 4

#Exponents:     - NOT A CARROT, USE TWIN ASTERISKS 
c = 10 ** 3
